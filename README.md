# Analysing-Union-Budget-Speeches-NLP-Project-
Objectives: I run complete analysis of the Union Budget speeches towards the folloiwng nested objectives:

To identify key sentiment of the speeches and their relationship with economic situation preceding and following the budget speech.

To characterise speeches based on the key topics or recurring themes discussed in them.

To use classification models to predict sentiment of new budget speech.

# Data set Info:
Information: For my project I use texts of budget speeches over the past decade and data on key economic variabes including annual growth rate figures for GDP, fiscal deficit (as % of GDP), inflation rate, IIP (over all, manufacturing & food) - for the same duration

# NOTE: 
Keeping in mind the classification exercise that I need to run later, I divide our budget speeches in two sets test and train

Test Set: Budget speech for 2020 will be our test set
Train Set: Budget speech from 2010 to 2019 form our train set.
